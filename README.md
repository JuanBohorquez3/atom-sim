# AtomSim
For simulating atom internal state dynamics with nice plotting functionality and generation of von Neumann ODE system.

Intended to allow varying levels of abstractified use, so the user can manually write as much or as little of their simulations as they choose, and have the help of things in this class as they want. Hardcode your equations, but use the plotting functionality. Generate your equations from a hamiltonian, but plot things with your own functions.
